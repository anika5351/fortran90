# 🚀 Fortran Programming Journey  

Welcome to my **Fortran Programming Repository**!  
Here, I have explored and implemented many programs, starting from **basic concepts** to **advanced techniques** in Fortran.  

## 📌 What You’ll Find
- ✅ Basic Fortran syntax and structure  
- ✅ Mathematical computations and numerical methods  
- ✅ Arrays, loops, and control structures  
- ✅ File handling and input/output operations  
- ✅ Matrix operations and linear algebra  
- ✅ Advanced numerical methods (e.g., iterative solvers, differential equations)  
- ✅ Real-world problem-solving with Fortran  

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository is my **learning journey** in mastering Fortran.  
It contains examples, practice codes, and projects that demonstrate how Fortran can be used in scientific and engineering applications.  

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Install a Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran`).  
2. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   gfortran program.f90 -o program
# fortran90
